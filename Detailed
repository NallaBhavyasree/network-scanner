# üîç Python Port Scanner ‚Äì Detailed Documentation

This Python script is a simple command-line tool that allows users to **scan a target website or IP address for open ports**. It's ideal for beginners learning about network programming or cybersecurity fundamentals.

---

## üß† What Does This Script Do?

1. **Takes a URL from the user.**  
2. **Resolves the domain name to its IP address.**  
3. **Scans a range of ports (default: 1‚Äì1024)** on that IP address to check which ports are open.  
4. **Prints out the open ports** found during the scan.

---

## üîß How the Script Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Importing Required Libraries
```python
import socket
from urllib.parse import urlparse
```
- `socket`: Used to perform networking operations (like resolving IP addresses and checking ports).
- `urlparse`: Breaks down the user-entered URL to extract the domain name.

---

### 2. `get_ip_from_url(url)`
This function takes a website URL and extracts the domain name to resolve it into an IP address.

#### Example:
Input: `https://example.com`  
Output: `93.184.216.34` (or whatever IP the DNS resolves to)

**How it works:**
- It uses `urlparse()` to separate the domain from the URL.
- Uses `socket.gethostbyname()` to translate the domain name to an IP address.
- If the domain is invalid or cannot be resolved, it prints an error and returns `None`.

---

### 3. `scan_ports(target_ip, start_port=1, end_port=1024)`
This function scans the specified IP address for open ports within a given range (default: ports 1 through 1024).

**How it works:**
- It loops through each port in the range.
- For each port, it tries to connect using a socket with a short timeout.
- If the connection is successful (i.e., returns `0`), the port is marked as open and printed to the screen.
- If the scan is interrupted (`Ctrl+C`), it exits gracefully.

---

### 4. `main()`
This is the entry point of the script.

**It does the following:**
1. Prompts the user to enter a URL.
2. Calls `get_ip_from_url()` to resolve the IP address.
3. If successful, calls `scan_ports()` to scan for open ports.
4. If it can't resolve the IP, it exits with an error message.

---

## üíª Example Usage

```bash
$ python3 scanner.py
Enter the website URL (e.g., https://example.com): https://google.com

Scanning 142.250.190.78 from port 1 to 1024...

[+] Port 80 is open
[+] Port 443 is open
...
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Ethics

- Only scan IP addresses or websites **you own or have permission to test**.
- Unauthorized scanning is illegal in many jurisdictions.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

This script gives you:
- Basic DNS resolution (domain to IP).
- A simple way to test which ports are open on a host.
- A great starting point for building more advanced network tools.
